# Command-line Data Analysis Tool
## Description
The Command-line Data Analysis Tool is a C# program that enables users to perform data analysis tasks from the command line. It provides functionalities such as statistical calculations, data visualization, and data manipulation. The tool utilizes multi-threading techniques to handle large datasets efficiently. The tool also uses LINQ to process data.

## Features
The Command-line Data Analysis Tool will include the following features:

1. Data Import/Export: The tool will allow users to import data from various file formats such as CSV or JSON. It will support reading and writing data in different formats to facilitate data exchange.

2. Statistical Calculations: Users can perform statistical calculations on their data, including measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, correlation, and regression analysis. The tool will provide methods to calculate these statistics for different variables and datasets.

3. Data Filtering and Manipulation: Users can apply filters to the dataset based on specific criteria, such as selecting rows based on column values or applying logical conditions. The tool will allow users to manipulate the data, such as sorting, grouping, and aggregating data based on specific columns.

4. Data Visualization: The tool will provide options for visualizing the data through various chart types, including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts. Users can choose the appropriate chart type to represent their data visually.

5. Data Exploration: Users can explore the dataset by examining its structure, such as viewing column names, and data types. The tool will provide descriptive information about the dataset to help users understand the data they are working with.

6. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The tool will include functionalities to clean and preprocess data, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types. Users can perform data cleansing operations to ensure the accuracy and quality of their data.

7. Command-line Interface: The tool will be designed as a command-line program, allowing users to interact with it through text-based commands and options. Users can input commands and specify parameters to perform different data analysis tasks.
